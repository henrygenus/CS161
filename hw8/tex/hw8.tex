	\item Our variables are: \{\\
			\indent LightSensor = whether light is currently sensed \\
			\indent SoundSensor = whether SamBot hears his dog barking,\\
			\indent Battery = whether SamBot's battery is OK, \\
			\indent Dog Barking = whether his dog is barking, \\
			\indent Dog Bowel Trouble = whether his dog is having bowel trouble, \\
			\indent Dog Outside = whether his dog is outside, \\
			\indent Expecting Guests = whether his family is expecting guests, \\
			\indent Family Home = whether his family is home, \\
			\indent Hearable Barking = whether he can hear barking, \\
			\indent Light Sensor Health = whether his light sensor is working, \\
			\indent Outdoor Light = whether the outdoor light is on, \\
			\indent Sound Sensor Health = whether his sound sensor is working \\
			\}\\

			\item MLE $|$ LightSensor $\land \ \neg$SoundSensor = \{\\
				\indent Battery = OK, \\
				\indent Dog Barking = No, \\
				\indent Dog Bowel Trouble =Yes, \\
				\indent Dog Outside = Yes, \\
				\indent Expecting Guests = No, \\
				\indent Family Home = No, \\

				Setting LightSensor and $\neg SoundSensor$ and using the MPE
					tool on the network gave us the following:

			\item MLE LightSensor, SoundSensor 
					$|$ FamilyHome $\land \ \neg$ExpectingGuests = \{\\
				\indent LightSensor = Off, \\
				\indent SoundSensor = Off, \\
				\} \\
				Setting FamilyHome and $\neg$ExpectingGuests and using the MPE
					tool on the network gave us the following:

			\item \begin{equation*}
					\text{MIN(\textbf{Z}) |  ND(SoundSensor, \textbf{Z}, LightSensor) 
					= \{Battery, FamilyHome\}} 
				\end{equation*}
			 \begin{proof}		
				We can see this by considering that all paths from SoundSensor to 
				LightSensor must flow through one of the two items in \textbf{Z}. \\
				
				Battery is divergent, so it blocks all paths through it. therefore \\
				\begin{equation*} 
					\text{blocked(SoundSensor, Battery, LightSensor)=True}
				\end{equation*}
				FamilyHome has two paths through it: \{ExpectingGuests, FamilyHome, 
				DogOutside\} and \{OutdoorLight, FamilyHome, 
				DogOutside\}.  The former is sequential and the latter is divergent,
				so both are blocked by assigning FamilyHome.  Therefore\\
				\begin{align*} 
					\text{blocked(ExpectingGuests, FamilyHome,  DogOutside)=True} \\ 
					\text{blocked(OutdoorLight, FamilyHome,  DogOutside)=True	}
				\end{align*}
				Thus we can see that\\ 
				\begin{equation*}
					\text{d\_SEP(SoundSensor, FamilyHome Battery, LightSensor)=True}
				\end{equation*}
				and therefore that\\
				\begin{equation*}
					\text{IND(SoundSensor, FamilyHome  Battery, LightSensor)=True.}
				\end{equation*}
				\end{proof}
			\item Our structure is multiply connected, as can be seen by the triangular 
				connection of FamilyHome, ExpectingGuests, and OutdoorLight,
